## Is this a port of TerraFirmaCraft?
TerraFabriCraft while heavily inspired by TerraFirmaCraft it's not a port in the usual way, during our initial decision to whether to port TerraFirmaCraft to newer versions or make a spiritual successor we went with the later option due to licensing issues that weren't resolved until after much of our development had already begun. However, we could not have made this if it weren't for the TerraFirmaCraft's developers's continuous help during development.
