# Contributing
Thank you for taking the time to contribute ðŸ˜„

Our project is open source and licenced under MIT, so suggestions, bug reports and most specially pull requests are welcome.

If you have a question about how to contribute, terrafabricraft#general channel in the Bloomhouse discord is the best place to start.

# How to contribute code
One of places where we currently need the most help with is guis and world gen. Guis such as the anvil's, crucible's, blast furnace's and forge's from old tfc. At the time of writing most guis are being rewritten to not use libgui so any contributions are heavily appreciated. World gen work has for the most part not started, so we're very receptive of any contribution to it.

If you're interested in committing code for any of those things please draft a Work-in-progress pull request so no two people work on the same thing

# Our coding conventions
This section lists some of our coding conventions you should know about before contributing.
1. Keep your commits as small and modular as possible, reviewing code takes time so ideally if you plan on making a pull request for two different features commit them separately to ease the review process
2. Inspect your uncommitted code with your IDE to format it consistently before committing.
3. Reformat your code to include the MIT copyright license header before committing. This can be done through IntelliJ IDEA's copyright profiles function.

# How to contribute assets
Most of our current assets are based on TerraFirmaCraft's 1.12 ones which don't exactly fit with Minecraft's current art style, if you have any experience with pixel art and are interested in contributing we invite you to join our team or make a pull request contributing new textures for any blocks or items.
