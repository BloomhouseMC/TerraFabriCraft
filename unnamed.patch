+# Contributing
+Thank you for taking the time to contribute ðŸ˜„
+
+Our project is open source and licenced under MIT, so suggestions, bug reports and most specially pull requests are welcome.
+
+If you have a question about how to contribute, terrafabricraft#general channel in the Bloomhouse discord is the best place to start.
+
+# How to contribute code
+One of places where we currently need the most help with is guis and world gen. Guis such as the anvil's, crucible's, blast furnace's and forge's from old tfc. At the time of writing most guis are being rewritten to not use libgui so any contributions are heavily appreciated. World gen work has for the most part not started, so we're very receptive of any contribution to it.
+
+If you're interested in committing code for any of those things please draft a Work-in-progress pull request so no two people work on the same thing
+
+# Our coding conventions
+This section lists some of our coding conventions you should know about before contributing.
+1. Keep your commits as small and modular as possible, reviewing code takes time so ideally if you plan on making a pull request for two different features commit them separately to ease the review process
+2. Inspect your uncommitted code with your IDE to format it consistently before committing.
+3. Reformat your code to include the MIT copyright license header before committing. This can be done through IntelliJ IDEA's copyright profiles function.
+
+# How to contribute assets
+Most of our current assets are based on TerraFirmaCraft's 1.12 ones which don't exactly fit with Minecraft's current art style, if you have any experience with pixel art and are interested in contributing we invite you to join our team or make a pull request contributing new textures for any blocks or items.

 ## Is this a port of TerraFirmaCraft?
-
-TerraFabriCraft is not a port of TerraFirmaCraft, but a reverse engineering of it. When we started the development of TerraFabriCraft we took the conscious decision not to look at TFC's source code because while TFC's code's license does allow for ports to other mod loaders (like fabric), their license also gives them the right to revoke it at any time, shutting down our project. What we did end up using are TFC's assets (textures, sounds, etc.), which we wanna thank all of TFC's artists for licensing under a much less restrictive license (CC BY-SA 4.0) that let us make this project a reality
-
-## Do you have any suggestions for what should be in TerraFabriCraft?
-You can let us know in the #Suggestions channel on our Discord! 
-
-## Can I run this mod now?
-Our mod is still in the development stages, so we're not providing any alpha or beta downloads just yet but keep an eye on our discord for updates on a possible alpha release in the next couple of months!
-
-## Where will this mod be available? 
-We're planning on making this mod available on as many platforms as possible! If you have any suggestions as to where we should upload this mod please let us know in our discord
+TerraFabriCraft while heavily inspired by TerraFirmaCraft it's not a port in the usual way, during our initial decision to whether to port TerraFirmaCraft to newer versions or make a spiritual successor we went with the later option due to licensing issues that weren't resolved until after much of our development had already begun. However, we could not have made this if it weren't for the TerraFirmaCraft's developers's continuous help during development.
